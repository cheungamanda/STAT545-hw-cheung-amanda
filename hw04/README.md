Homework 04 process
================

Here is the [link](https://github.com/cheungamanda/STAT545-hw-cheung-amanda/blob/master/hw04/hw04_tidy-data-joins.md) to homework 04.

#### General data reshaping and relationship to aggregation

Making my own cheat sheet was helpful to understand the concepts much better. I used a [R studio cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) for guidance. I used this [website](http://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-create-a-data-frame-from-scratch-in-r/) for help creating a data frame.

For Activity 2, I was intially stuck when I used the gather() function. I realized I was actually looking to use the spread() function and everything else was straightforward from there. I used this [website](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html) for help with the slope line.

For Activity 3, I wasn't sure which plots were easier to make with the new data shape. I thought a scatterplot comparing continents would be difficult with the usual form, so I made a scatterplot using the new data shape!

Activity 4 was quite difficult at first. I decided to try collapsing multiple rows into one, and this [website](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2015/06/27/r-dplyr-squashing-multiple-rows-per-group-into-one/) was quite helpful for me to figure out the paste function.

#### Join, merge, look up

This activity was helpful to understand the join functions. I have a much better grasp of the different functions and when to use them now! I used the [cheatsheet](http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html#semi_joinsuperheroes-publishers) from the course website for help with this section.
