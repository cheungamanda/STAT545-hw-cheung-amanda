Homework 05 Process
================

Here is the link to [homework 05](https://github.com/cheungamanda/STAT545-hw-cheung-amanda/blob/master/hw05/hw05_factor-figure-management.md)!

### Factor management

This part of the assignment was quite straight forward. The [class notes](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html) were very helpful in guiding me through these assignments. I had some difficulties with the `arrange()` activity in the beginning. I realized I had to use fct\_drop() to get the level order of the filtered countries. I also used this [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) to learn how to hide warning messages for the knitr tibbles with no headers.

### File I/O

This section was difficult to understand at first, since it wasn't explained well in class. The [class notes](http://stat545.com/block026_file-out-in.html) were very helpful once again.

### Visualization and writing figures to file

I used the [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm013-notes_and_exercises.html) and Tamara Munzer's lecture tips! I also used this handy [r graph gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/ggplot2-package/) and [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).
