Homework 02 process
================

The markdown file for the homework 02 submission is named [hw02\_gapminder.md](https://github.com/cheungamanda/STAT545-hw-cheung-amanda/blob/master/hw02/hw02_gapminder.md).

### Make a homework repo

This part was fairly straightforward and I didn't encounter any difficulties.

### Bring rectangular data in

This part was also easy, since I simply had to load gapminder and tidyverse (which we've previously done).

### Smell test the data

I used the [class notes](http://stat545.com/block006_care-feeding-data.html) to explore the gapminder object. I also used a [R tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_data_types.htm) to look at R data types.

### Explore individual variables

I found this part a little tricky, since there was a lot of freedom to present the data. It could be approached in many ways, so I tried to present different plots. I used a [R graph gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/ggplot2-package/) to look at the variety of plots I could incorporate. I found a helpful [website](http://dwoll.de/rexrepos/posts/diagCategorical.html) teaching me how to make a pie chart.

### Explore various plot types

This part was also hard, because of there were so many options to present the plots. Creating data subsets was hard even thought it was done in class. I was extra careful and read over the class notes. I used the websites linked above and the [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm005-notes_and_exercises.html) for this section. I found different websites for details on making [bar charts](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html), [histograms](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html), and [box plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html).
