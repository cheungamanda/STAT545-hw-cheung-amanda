Homework 03 process
================

#### Task 1

I tried the `knitr::kable()` function to make a decent looking table. It wasn't hard to figure out, and I used this format for the rest of my tables in this assignment. I had a hard time figuring out how to make a grouped bar plot. However, I found a helpful [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39061984/grouped-bar-chart-on-r-using-ggplot2), which guided me through making the plot. I used this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16074440/r-ggplot2-center-align-a-multi-line-title) for help on centre aligning a plot title.

#### Task 2

I wasn't sure how to represent the spread of GDP per capita, so I showed the median, mean, and standard deviation (on top of the maximum and minimum) values. I had fun exploring the different plots, and using a variety of plots to show the distribution. I found a [R graph gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/ggplot2-package/) and [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf), which were incredibly helpful. I also used a website showing all the [ggplot2 colours](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour) I can use to customize my plot!

#### Task 3

I had no idea what a trimmed mean was, but now I know! I found [R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DescTools/versions/0.99.19/topics/Trim) and another [R library](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/mean.html) website to figure help with the trimmed mean.

#### Task 4

I incorporated the trimmed mean from Task 3 for this section of the assignment. The table and plots were pretty straightforward.

#### Task 5

I realized that I like to make plots and customize them. I'm not a huge fan of tables.

#### Task 6

I decided to continue exploring the life expectancy variable. I put my tables into variables, so I could incorporate the data in my plots. This made the code neater and easier to follow in my opinion.
